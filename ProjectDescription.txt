Description
Accidents in traffic lead to significant fatalities and economic losses worldwide. For this reason, 
it is of primary concern to city planners and governments to improve road safety for both drivers 
and pedestrians.
Developing a model that predicts accident severity based on various external 
conditions such as current weather, road conditions and visibility can prove to be a valuable tool
that provides insights into isolating the factors that are deemed most dangerous.In addition,
this type of model can also be used to alert drivers and pedestrians to avoid travelling while 
these factors are present or take an alternative route for their travel. 
Avoidance of such conditions will result in significant positive benefits for the city such as reduced fatalities and less infrastructure damage.
