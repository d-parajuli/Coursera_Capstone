Introduction:
I would like to develop a model that predicts the severity of car collisions
and crashes given the current weather, road conditions and visibility. 
In adverse weather conditions, there can be dangerous consequences
of road accidents. 
This model will divide the severity score into various buckets and 
alert drivers of adverse conditions so they can avoid travel during
the given time or take an alternative route.
